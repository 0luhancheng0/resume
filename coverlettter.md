Dear whom it may concern, 

I would like to apply for the position of R&D Computer and Engineering. I believe I will be well suited given my professional background and my passion for the field. 

I’m currently in my final year of Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours) degree. My professional interest is to advance the scientific discovery using computational approach. 

I first encountered machine learning during my vacation internship at CSIRO. I was working on implementing an state-of-the-art method for estimating uncertainty in a large-scale convolutional neural network that is part of the crystallography image processing pipeline. I have since then developed a passion for the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have dived into multiple sub-field of artificial intelligence, including multi-agent reinforcement learning, meta-learning and self-supervised learning. And I was later involved in multiple inter-disciplinary machine learning projects.

Furthermore, I have a concrete theoretical background. I’m interested in the numeric method, information theory and optimization. In one of the most influential international HPC competition, I undertook the task to optimize high-performance conjugate gradient (HPCG), which is a metric for benchmarking how well a HPG system deals with sparse matrix. 

I’m capable of extending my knowledge to real-world scenarios. I’m working part-time at Monash eResearch Center supporting one of the largest super-computer for biomedical imaging at Australia. At the same time, I’m leading an engineering students team that set the mission of educating, empowering and engaging student, researchers and community about artificial intelligence. These have all been done while studying my full-time honours degree. It taught me how to multi-tasking and prioritising works. 

 To conclude, I hope I may be considered for further assessment, and i am looking forward to getting in touch with you. 

Best Regards
Thank you

Dear whom it may concern, 

As a computer science graduate, I’m interested in applying my knowledge in high-performance computing, software engineering and machine learning to advance scientific discovery. I believe i can contribute to build more scalable and robust distributed computing infrastructure at Anyscale. 

I first encounter ray through RLlib, which is used in my final year project to implement multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. RLlib has been, to the best of my knowledge, the only library that provides decent support to multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. I’m very keen to do more work on RLlib to improve its usability, 

I have adequate experience working with high-performance, distributed systems. From the university, I received formal training on parallel computing, including message passing (MPI), remote procedure call and thread level parallelism. I have worked as technical consultant in Monash eResearch Center, responsible for providing system analysis, software development and user support to the users on the high-performance clusters. My experience in these areas can better help me understand the design requirement of next generation distributed computing applications. 

I have received decent amount of exposure to functional programming, mainly in Haskell and TypeScript, and software engineering practise. I will be able to adopt these skills to help design architecture that support better usability. 

I also hold leadership role in medium-size engineering student team, responsible for management, delivering training event and public workshops about HPC/ML to the community. I will be able to help designing more accessible documentation and more engaging user supports.

 To conclude, I hope I may be considered for further assessment, and i am looking forward to getting in touch with you. 

Best Regards
Thank you
