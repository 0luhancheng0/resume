### Overview of what i have studied, future directions



I am currently doing my honours degree of computer science. And prior to that i have finished a Bachelor of Computer Science degree with 79 average mark. So i had good overall understanding of basic software development as well as a strong theoretical foundataion. 
I have specialised in two area. One is high-performance computing, i’m currently doing part-time job at Monash providing user support on one of the largest high-performance cluster. 
The other one is machine learning. Actually, the objective of my honours project is to combine multi-agent reinforcement learning and game theory to study the problem of cooperation and coordination. 
In the future, i would like to work in field that can utilise both high-performance computing and machine learning knowledge, because it is just what i love to do that i think there are still lots of potential oppotunities. 

### additional projects, experiences or extra curricular activities 

involved with that support your application ?

I have a few projects that i have been working on. I’m in the leadership team of Monash DeepNeuron, which is an engineering student team that provide students the opportunity to learn deep learning and apply them to important research projects. 
In 2018, i was part of the Monash student cluster competition team. Among 18 teams, we were the only team from Australia. This challenge is arguably the most influential competition in the field high-performance computing. We were tasked to run 6 scientific applications, including seismic simulation, weather forecasting and deep learning in this 48 hour non-stopping competition. 
Lastly, i spent one of my summer at CSIRO working on implementing an uncertainty measurement for one of the large-scale neural network that is part of the existing crystallography image pipeline. 

### strengths as an individual



I think i have been good at multi-tasking, that is prioritising works and work under stressful situation. 
Currently, i have a full time university course and a part-time job while leading a student team, so i can sometimes be stressful but it helps me learn knowledge in a relatively short period. 
I’m self-motivated, I often manage to spare some time to do some online tutorials. I love reading interesting technical blogs and listening to insightful podcast. 
These strengths helped me to build a strong technical knowledge foundation. At the same time, i like collaborating, teaching and communicating with others because it’s the best way of inspiring ideas. 





### background (what you study), how the skill contribute to sysmex if the application is successful, why you want to work in sysmex at Japan. 2-3mins



Hi, i’m Luhan Cheng. I’m currently studying my honours degree of computer science at Monash University,  Melbourne, Australia. My skill set is specialised in high-performance computing and machine learning , which i believe aligns well with what sysmex is doing. I have prior experience working with large scale neural network that is used in protein crystallography pipeline. I have also had experience working as system admin at Monash eResearch centre help managing the high-performance cluster, so if you would like to build any data processing pipeline, i can help you make it both scalable and robust. Besides the engineering side, i also love exploring science side of my work, actually my final year project is about how to build artificial intelligence that can both generalise and adapt to different environment, which is fairly theoretical and involves a lot of exploratory work. I love sharing and teaching, i was engaged in helping the delivery of courses which have a diversed set of topics related to machine learning and high-performance computing, and i would love to share my knowledge and learn from you guys. 

I chose to apply for this internship opportunity at sysmex, because the work you do at sysmex is exactly what i’m interested. I have been looking for an opportunity to apply my knowledge in an inter-disciplinary project that could potential have a significant impact on our society, and i’m really motivated by the potentiality of advancing our toolset in life science research. Besides that, I have been studying at Australia for 4 years, but prior to i actually spent most of my life in China, which has a entirely different caltrual background. I realised that being able to explore different culture is a very important part of life, and i do really enjoy the experience of moving into a different country and engage with another community. So i’m really looking forward to having this work opportunity at Japan. I believe it will an amazing piece of experience.
