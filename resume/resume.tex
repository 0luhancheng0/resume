\section{\faBriefcase\ Profile}

As a computer science (Honours) graduate, I'm interested in applying computational approach to scientific problems that have significant impact upon
  our society.

I have experience in variety of topics including High-performance computing, machine learning, numerical optimization, game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I recently joined the PhD program at Centre for Information Resilience (CIRES), Swinburne University, working on applying natrual language processing and
  machine learning to create a pathway for automated knowledge mining from scientific articles and invention patents
